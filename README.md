i don't stop

This is the web conversion of the iOS app based on an installation project by Emma Hendrix and Julie Gendron.

Double a button to record up to 5 seconds of audio. Click to play each button in a loop. Press and hold to bring up a menu for changing the name on a button, sharing the sound from the button to a server, or downloading a random sound from the server.

Can be run locally from within the Google App Engine SDK for Python runner (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads?hl=en). The server is only needed for sharing or downloading files, all other functionality can work offline.
